    Improvement migration path when shifting docker container
    tailing from the socket to file. If tailing from file
    for Docker containers is enabled, containeris with an existing
    entry relative to a socket tailer will continue being tailed
    from the Docker socket unless the following newly introduced
    option is set to true:
    ``logs_config.docker_container_force_use_file``. It aims to
    allow smooth transition to file tailing for Docker containers.
